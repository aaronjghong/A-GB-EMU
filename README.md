# A-GB-EMU

A-GB-EMU (Aaron's Gameboy Emulator) is an ongoing project where I delve deeper into emulation by attempting to make an emulator for the original gameboy.

## What's been done

-   First steps of hardware implementation in code
-   Opcode array (for fetch and decode)
-   First few Opcode functions (execute)

## Next steps

-   Finish Opcode Functions
-   Start work with memory (memory control, memory banking, boot rom, etc.)
-   Learn about Gameboy's display
-   Get timings correct
-   Implement interrupts
-   Implement graphics
-   Connect to SDL and implement controls
-   Implement sound
